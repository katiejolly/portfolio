At my office hours for Introduction to Data Science (COMP 112) one night, some students mentioned they felt like they needed more practice with data wrangling and dplyr. 



So the next day I wrote an activity for them to work through. It ended up being really helpful for the students who worked on it with me and made them much more confident in using dplyr! I've also presented this activity at R Ladies- Twin Cities. 


The activity is available [here](http://katiejolly.io/bikeshare-dplyr/). Feel free to share it!
