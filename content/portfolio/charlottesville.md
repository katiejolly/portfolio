In my Metro Analysis class, we had to pick a city to study during the semester.



I chose Charlottesville, so I analyzed residential segregation, the housing market, and the job market in the metro area. 

For the residential segregated, we used the dissimilarity index. 

I made a plot showing which racial groups were most and least segregated in the metro area:

The rest of the code and data for the project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/katiejolly/Charlottesville) and maybe at some point I'll get around to writing more about it!
