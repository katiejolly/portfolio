A lot of my work involves digitizing maps so that they can be used in GIS software and for geographic data science projects. Recently I have been working with a local of voting precinct maps in particular.

As part of that work, I collaborated with two other co-authors to write a quick guide that could help us when we led large workshops. I later decided to go back and redesign the guide so that it would be more visually appealing and user friendly. 

The full guide is available [here](/pdf/digitizing_guide.pdf) and is available for public use (we just ask that you give us credit). 

The general structure of the guide is georeferencing > vectorizing > additional notes and resources.

The guide includes "highlight" pages to cover specific topics that I think are important but are not directly included in the steps for digitizing.

And each of the pages covers a specific task step-by-step so that it is beginner friendly and further democratizes this aspect of civic data.
