For my design class we made business cards (or art cards) that we thought represented us well.

I decided to make a map of some of Saint Paul on one side of my card and include my contact info on the other side. It went through a few iterations until I finally settled on one that I liked the most! The map was made with `tigris` and `ggplot2` in R.
