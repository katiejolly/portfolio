As I've used R more for projects and become more familiar with the code structure, I've become interested in the development side of the R community. I decided to try writing my own package. In order to do this, I used a number of online resources and followed the examples of other packages. My package uses the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and allows you to get life advice and write it on a poster.
