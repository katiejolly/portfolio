When I first started learning R and Python, I had a tough time trying to remember everything I'd learned. It was a lot of new information all at once! I found that writing it down helped so much, even if I never went back to look at what I'd written.

I was excited about the document I'd been keeping for myself of things I'd learned related to data science, so I decided to share it on Twitter! It turned out that a lot of other people found it useful as well!

So, I turned it into a Github repository so that other people could contribute via issues and pull requests as well. 

Check it out [here](https://github.com/katiejolly/data-resources)!

And if you have anything you'd like me to add, feel free to submit it! I love that it is a community-driven doc so I'm happy to add things.
