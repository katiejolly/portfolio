advicegiver was my first attempt at R package writing! I was pretty proud of what I was able to produce. And it's available  on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/katiejolly/advicegiver)!

The package serves as a wrapper to the [adviceslip API](https://adviceslip.com/) and gives a random piece of not-at-all to extremely helpful life advice (subjectively speaking). I've also included functions that allow you to paste the message onto one of a few preloaded images. You could also use the same steps to load your own background image! 

I wrote a bit about the writing process and some things I learned on my [blog](http://katiejolly.io/blog/2018-05-02/advicegiveR). Check out the package if you're interested!
