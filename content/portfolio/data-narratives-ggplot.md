I wrote this tutorial and presented it at R Ladies Twin Cities. It uses fivethirtyeight biopics data and begins by recreating their graphics. Feel free to use it and share it!

The tutorial is available [here](http://katiejolly.io/data-narratives-ggplot/)! I'm really excited about this topic so I'm excited to share this document with everyone. 

My style for teaching data viz is to start by recreating existing plots. For this activity I walk you through recreating the plots from a FiveThirtyEight [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/straight-outta-compton-is-the-rare-biopic-not-about-white-dudes/) about representation in biopics. The last part of the activity gives some prompts for other vizzes! 

Some screenshots from the activity are below:
