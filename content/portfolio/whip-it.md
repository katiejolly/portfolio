In Fall 2018 I wrote my senior capstone for statistics with [Katya Kelly](https://ykelly.github.io/) about minorities in *MasterChef Junior*. 

We were interested in doing a survival analysis of minority contestants with and without a female judge. We generally found that female contestants do better with a female judge, but the effect is not as strong for racial minorities. 

Here's a plot of our survival model based on the gender of the contestant:

And the plot of our survival model based on the race of the contestant:

You can read our [paper](/pdf/survival_analysis_paper.pdf) or wait for our blog post about it! We loved doing the project and learned a ton in the process. We hope you enjoy reading it!
